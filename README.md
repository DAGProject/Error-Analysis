# Error-Analysis
### This Module contains methods to calculates basic mathematical functions with error

Functions:
- sum
- subtract
- multiply
- divide
- mean
- stdv (STDV is an error itself. However in some cases, such as DIMM Calculations, changes in location driven from STDV of x, y coordinates and x and y coordinates has uncertainties and this error must be caaried after STDV calculation. http://www.astro.auth.gr/~seeing-gr/seeing_gr_files/theory/node13.html)

for usage look at:
